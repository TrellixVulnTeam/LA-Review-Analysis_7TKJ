1,"Jul 16, 2021","Used them for 2 personal loans in the past with no issues. So figured when I wanted to re-finance my house give them a shot. What a mistake, should have used a local company. They hired an appraiser from an hour away. The dude was at my house for 10 minutes. Was rude on the phone. My house is $421,000 on zillow. I had it appraised 3 years ago for $330,000 and put $60,000 in upgrades. The market is RED HOT. Houses like mine selling for $450,000+ 4/3/3 pool/jacuzzi The appraiser lists my house for $357,000. That's $64,000 under zillow. A house sold next door 3 weeks ago with less square feet, a 2 car garage (I have a 3) NO POOL or JACUZZI for the SAME price $357,000? Everyone I spoke with laughed at the appraisal. Some are relators. So my house is worth the same as this house with half the stuff. The support was a joke, like nothing we can do. I had to submit the new comps. I paid $500 for the appraisal its not my job to do the work. Going to use a local company from now on, learn from my mistake RUN RUN RUN!",TOTAL WASTE of TIME!,15,1

1,"Jun 28, 2021","SOFI has to take the honor of one of the worst companies that I have dealt with. If there was a way to give them zero stars, i would gladly do it. All the way from refinancing to dealing with customer service been a nightmare. I had to submit my loan docs multiple times and my request for setting bi-monthly payments was never honored. So I pick up the phone to call customer service and they tell me they will help me to setup “Budget draft”, which is same as bi-monthly payments. I been calling for the past 3months, filled up “Budget Draft” form 3times and talked with about 4-5reps. Every time I call, I am being told a different story as to why it cannot be setup and provided with different directions. Don’t know whom to believe any longer.

5,"Jun 23, 2021","Quick Approval! I applied 7p (CST) and woke up to an approval at 8a. The next morning. The rate was nice and with direct payment to my credit cards they lowered the rate by .25%. Also, setting up automatic payments lowered my rate as well. There was no initiation fee so I received 100% what I requested. The only negative is, I paid closed attention when filling out the application and did not notice a field to put my bank account information in (to receive funds). I assumed it would come up in the next step. However the approval came with them setting me up a MONEY account to receive the funds. With the assumption that I’d use it as my main account and have the payments deducted from that account. I caught it in the documents and changed it right away to my bank and that caused a couple hours delay. But that’s fine. I was told the funding would be done in 2-3 business days so we shall see.",Fast/Quick turn around.,4,1

5,"May 13, 2021","This is the second time I've used Sofi. My debt to income ratio was 30% with no negative marks on my credit report and 200K+ income.

I just received another loan for $99000 to payoff high interest cc (11% to 17.99%) and a pool loan. I got a rate around 9% for 4 years, but was offered rates as low as 5.99% for 2 - 3 years.

4,"Aug 15, 2020","I wanted to get a loan to refinance credit card debt at a better interest rate. I decided to apply for the loan before my credit moved into the excellent category (as I wanted to try for a better rate) but decided to go ahead as part of my debt paydown plan. The application process was very easy and not tedious. It did take longer to get approved than stated, but that was partially due to needing to use a more recent pay stub, and verify my income. Customer service was very knowledgeable, and helped me make a slight adjustment to the loan to get the terms I wanted. Interest rate is not fantastic, but it beat some of the other competitors who charge fees, and it is much better than the 27% or more I was paying on a discover card. Once the loan approved, the funds were deposited the next day, and I immediately began paying off the credit cards; which has already greatly improved my credit score, and put me in a better position to refinance my home mortgage soon! I spent months looking at loan options and offers from other lenders, and I would definitely recommend SoFi to others.",,97,14

1,"Jun 06, 2020","This is a very unprofessional outfit. They pre-approved me for a mortgage. Then the loan officer disapperared. Then a couple of account officers appeared who knew very little about underwriting. I paid $500 for their appraisal and then they start questioning everything. The account officers could provide no answers. Turns out they work out of their place of residence, have no ability for f2f with their colleagues and are just gladhanders.

1,"Mar 31, 2020","Applied for a personal loan to consolidate 3 other personal loans. My credit score at the time was 770. SoFi hit my my three credit reports with (7) different hard pulls. I tried for two years to have those redundant hard pulls removed. I went the normal route and went direct to the credit reporting agencies and disputed the numerours, unnecessary har pulls and SoFi responded to them that the pulls were legitimate. I contacted SoFi direct, for weeks, back and forth by email and they NEVER rfesolved this. I have never ben late on a payment, have 207K income and an 820 creedit score. SoFi purposely, malicously and illegally refused to remove those absurd amounts of hard pulls for only one appllication as it dropped my credit score 20 points and hurt me for loans I got a few months later. They did not removedthose hard pulls and put that many to hurt my credit score and subsequently I lost money with other loans. My credit was perfect then, and is perfect now. Had to see and feel SoFi's impact on my credit score and money for two years until those fraudulent hard pulls aged off of my credit reports. SoFi, you can go F%$K yourselves.

Do not get your hopes up just because you get pre approved. I was pre approved for $100,000 so then I send them everything they ask for and they deny me all together. Didn't even offer me a smaller loan just nothing and all my information was the same as the pre approval. A reputable company would not pre approve you and then deny you after you give them everything they ask for. What's the point of a pre approval? How can a company pre approve you for a loan and then for no reason deny your loan? Well so many people all over have said the same thing.

1,"Jan 13, 2018","This company gave me the runaround. I applied with a co-signer to refinance my student loans and from the beginning, the process was complicated. The application was all online, but as a stay-at-home parent, I am technically ""unemployed,"" so the application was not really geared towards someone in my position. I had to actually call customer service and have them put in a note that I was a stay-at-home parent so that they could process the application with me being ""unemployed."" So then I had to upload a bunch of loan statements, which was fine, and my co-signer had to upload his paystubs, again, fine, and I happily submitted my application for review. Then, they told me the documents I uploaded weren't all correct, so I fixed them. Then, I heard nothing. For weeks. So I called. They explained that I was missing some documents--namely a copy of my co-signer's signed social security card--why? I couldn't tell you. My co-signer was having trouble finding his card, so I asked the woman I spoke to on the phone if they could submit the application without the card. She said she didn't see a reason why they needed it and would try to re-submit my application without the card. So she did that (I assume) and then a couple days later I receive a call from this woman Sandra stating that they still need my co-signer's social security card. So we went on a frantic hunt for the card, finally found it, took a photo of it and submitted it. Then my application was complete, right? NOPE. Heard nothing, so called again, and this time they stated that one of my loan documents was incomplete and they needed more info. Which, I guess never occurred to them to tell me THE LAST TIME I spoke to them! So I told the man I was speaking with that I was very annoyed with their lack of communication and he apologized and said they would do better in the future. Fine. Great. Fixed the document WITH the man over the phone. All is well? Yes, mam, he told me. But it wasn't, because Miss Sandra called me back a few days later and said I needed to update some of my statements as they were a couple months old now and considered expired. SO, I call them yet again, ask EXACTLY what they need. They tell me. So I go ahead and upload everything they asked for. Up to date now, right?? NOPE. Miss Sandra calls me back again the next day and says they need additional updates, plus an updated pay-stub from my co-signer......Now, keep in mind that as a stay-at-home parent of 2 children under 3, my life is a bit hectic and needless to say, I don't have a lot of time during the day to sit down and iron out these issues over the phone with these people. So you can imagine that when I do get a chance to call in, talk to an actual person, and have them talk me through everything, it's incredibly frustrating and disheartening to find out that they didn't tell me everything I need or neglected to mention that some info was incomplete WHILE THEY WERE SPEAKING TO ME AND I ASKED AGAIN AND AGAIN. SO at this point, I am very frustrated--almost livid. And I login today (just 2 days after my last voicemail from Sandra), only to find out my application is EXPIRED and if I want to get a loan with them, I need to start this horrendous process ALL OVER AGAIN. So, in conclusion, I found working with SoFi severely LACKING (to say the least) in communication, customer service skills, and ease of use with their online application. I feel like they really just didn't want to help me and stalled me until my loan expired. I really do feel screwed over by this company, and I'm angry. And frustrated. And SO disappointed, since this company had pretty decent reviews in general. As a parent, I am trying to get my debt under control so that I can make a better life for my children and not constantly have that debt hanging over our family. This seemed like a great opportunity to refinance my loans and save some money. I am highly dissatisfied and disappointed by my experience with SoFi and would not work with them again.

As long as you are honest with your income, able to prove it for the past 2 years, have good credit, good debt-to-income, etc., it's a VERY easy process. The guest-service was EXTREMELY helpful. They processed my application and information SO quickly, in less than 48 hours I not only applied and qualified, but I also was able to sign AND receive my funds in my bank. Two things to mention, my bank is usually VERY fast at releasing/processing funds, so it may take longer for some. Second, my loan ended up being a little less as some of my income did not have a 2 year history, this is VERY important. Also, self-employed makes things take a little longer. Overall though, all the reviews that say they were unhelpful, denied, fakes, etc., HAVE to be individuals who are just upset they didn't qualify or had something in their history that did not approve them which CLEARLY they should know already. SoFI as a company, especially their guest service, is SUPERB. I'll be coming back for anything in the future to them when it comes to loans or mortgages.

2,"Dec 04, 2017","Was attracted to Sofi due to their inviting marketing and advertising through Google and other mediums that made the company seem so attractive. I wanted to refinance my loans to lower my interest rate and monthly premium to a reasonable amount. The fixed rate initially seemed a bit high, so I elected for the variable rate. I was pretty disappointed by the initial rate I got (4.95% about 2 years ago) considering my very high credit score and decent salary, considering it was almost their highest in the range of variable rates. However, because I just wanted to get it done quickly, I accepted it and refinanced. Since I started, my rate has increased about 20 times (not exaggerating), and as of today is 6.34%! I realize that the LIBOR has increased, but considering that my credit score, income, and savings, has also increased, this is just plain outrageous. Did a quick easy search on Earnest with my current information and was offered a FIXED rate below 5.5%. When I called customer service at Sofi about this, the repeated answer I got was ""sorry, sir, but you picked variable rate...if you want a new rate you have to apply again.""

The entire process was quick, online and expedited - what you would expect from any modern company but rarely receive. Sofi is way ahead of the game in this regard.

I have never been great at managing money, I have a great job that pays well, but I was never taught to control and limit my spending habits. As a result, I quickly racked up $10,000+ in credit card debt. Since digging this hole I have done more to limit my spending on frivolous things, cut up cards to specific accounts and closed my most recent cards that were under a year old. I took several classes offered at work that were aimed at bettering financial self-control. I have a long way to financial freedom, but SoFi approved me for a loan to pay this debt off at an interest rate FAR lower than my credit card accounts (-10%). I have already paid my accounts off and it feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I truly appreciate the service SoFi provides. They truly are looking to help people that show signs and progress towards bettering themselves financially - this includes paying off accounts, making larger than normal payments to bring those balances down and no history of late payments.

1,"Jul 11, 2017","It is obvious that a lot of reviews here for SoFi are paid reviews because they all talk about the quick speed. I applied for a personal loan which even after two weeks was still in final review. There were many things wrong with this whole process 1. Despite having a fraud alert I never received a verification call from SoFi. In fact their customer support team didn't even know what was a fraud alert. They kept insisting that Experian needs to verify my information and not them. 2. For ten days after the three day period was over I kept hearing the same status that the application was in final review. Even up to this point I had received no call for the verification 3. One of their managers Josh Johnson gave me personal assurance that the loan will be processed by it's 11th day and he will follow up personally. On the 12, 13 and 14 days of my calls, he was nowhere to be found. According to the agents he had left for home at 12 pm central time. 4. The entire application was ridiculously slow and I chose to withdraw it which was with drama again. Upon requesting to talk to a manager before withdrawing the application I was rather transferred after the rep withdrew the application. The manager said they could not remove the credit inquiry though they had never honored the fraud application or their terms. Plus he said that for the fault of their own rep I had to start the application again. Well no thank you. In this same time we had a mortgage application put in a day after the application for the loan. It was close to a million dollars versus the 35k requested here and it was approved before this one was. Just to share a reference of how SoFi is NOT what they claim to be. Oh and quite amazingly when the manager who called me with a disclaimer that the call will be recorded for monitoring was fazed and said he didn't give consent to the fact that the call was being recorded on my phone. So stay away from these guys. I am sure I would have faced more problems with the loan itself. They seem like frauds and might very well be so. Go with folks more reliable than these guys.

No missed payments, very low credit usage... Well over 720 score. After being approved, we sent over our documents as requested. We had send multiple forms of income verification which seemed redundant considering many of the forms were the same. I had to send my identification multiple times because of claims that it couldn't be viewed. Just to see if they were ""full of time after the third time, I sent the exact same passport picture as the first time. It was accepted. Annoyed. They advertised low rates. After I completed the application and they ran my credit (an inquiry), they assesed an apr of 11%. ??? Seriously? When asked why, they said that it was because I didn't have a college degree. Hhhmmm... My income is substantial, I'm a navy veteran, I've never missed a payment on anything my entire life. Awful judgement call. Really should have backed out then but I was concerned about there being a credit pull and no account. I figured it may look like a denial if I didn't take it. I proceeded - against my wife's advice. Oh, I didn't mention that I had called customer three times by now and two of the three times were painful. The representatives seemed so unknowing and unaware of the product and the terms. I literally gave up asking questions after the last call. Finally, what prompted me to write this review. So because I wqnt to get them ""out of my hair"" ASAP, I decided to pay them off 5 times quicker. Loan amount $9k, 7 year term. After 2 months, I've brought the balance to $5k. I look at my report and it's still reporting close to $9k balance. Now, If I had paid $4k in one shot I may not be aggravated. I would assume that maybe I paid the lump sum after closing and my payment hasn't caught up to the reporting. However, I intentionally didn't do it that way. I maid multiple payments weeks before I knew the balance would be reported and still... The nasty icing on this awful cake is, when I contacted customer service by email to request that the balance is updated with the major credit bureaus, they responded that ""Thank you for your email, we need you to contact Experian with your dispute.

In the past I had gotten such an offer in the mail and I thought about it but did not apply. This time I thought I might as well find out what interest rate I might get. You can go to their website and get an estimate of the interest rate on a proposed loan (they do a soft pull for this). The interest rate of the actual loan was right in line with their estimate. I found the online application process to be easy - it is really pretty straight forward. I cannot speak about how the process is for student loans or other things, but the process for a personal loan was simple and efficient. I was approved and funded in just several days. At the end of the process they will give you a phone call and ask you to verify some information. Before the phone call, they will send you an e-mail just saying they will call you from a certain phone number - that way you know that the phone call is legitimate. My credit score is 728 and the interest rate was about in the middle range of what I expected and the loan was for rather more than $10,000. I kind of thought the loan process would be intimidating like an interrogation (I had a bad experience unrelated to this several years ago when I applied for a loan at a credit union).

My credit was not super bad mid 600's but not great either and all due to my balances having nothing to do with my pay history (which was never late). A few years back the banks cut my limits in half, killing my limit to balance ratios and impacting my score big time by 100 points. Then the new scoring system came out and my score went down another 30 points or so. Have been struggling since then to pay down and off as many cards as I could to get my score back. It was tough but I did get rid of some of the cards, now this loan is helping me kill the rest in 3 years, saving me over $400 per month compared to the same plan to kill my cards in 4 years on my own.

This was way faster, cheaper and easier than my previous 3 LendingClub loans with no origination fee. Very pleased! The only gripe is that there are no email notifications of things you need to do along the way. If you want to keep things moving you need to login and check the status often. In my case it went like this: 1)Got my initial pre-approval and rate. 2)Uploaded ID and last pay stub. 3)Checked back next day and noticed they wanted last 2 years end of year pay stubs to verify bonuses. 4)Almost instantly after I uploaded those, the loan docs were ready to sign!! (if you get to this point your loan is solid) 5)Couple hours later I got the call to verify my info. 6)Couple hours later received text that loan was funded. 7)Next morning money in account!

5,"Sep 11, 2016","I applied for a personal loan from SoFi to consolodate high interest credit cards. SoFi allowed me to do a soft pull when applying for a loan so I could comparison shot based on the actual interest rate without dinging my credit. My situation included 100% on time payments, and a steady job with sufficient income, but high credit card balances. SoFi offered the best rate I could find and didn't do the hard pull until after I accepted the loan. The calculator was very helpful in deciding how much to borrow for how long. The web site is very simple, which I greatly appreciate. It keeps the process straight forward and easy. After receiving the loan, the web site and monthly statements continued to be straight forward and helpful. I've had financial products over the years that hide one piece of key information or another, but not with SoFi. The interest rate, current balance, number of payments remaining, total interest you've paid, nothing to hide, all of it is easy to find. It's also easy to set up and change automatic payments. Other banks ""skip"" the next autopay when I make a change, but no issues with that here. One time payments are also easy to request for all the usual scenarios: paying extra principle, paying next month early, or to do a payoff. With the processing being so simple and straightfoward, and since I always make payments on time through autopay, I had no issues to call customer service about during the servicing of the loan. During the application process I wanted to change the loan terms after reaching the last stage of the process, which is to electronically sign the agreement. Since I hadn't signed the document yet, customer service was able to change the terms. It took 1 business day for them to update the system, then I accepted the loan.

I inputed income (no place to put employer), my personal info, and what I intended the loan for, I had to select ""payoff other loans"". My intention was to payoff an existing LendingClub loan I opened 4 months ago minus $5k I wanted to put towards payoff in cash, asking for $6k to replace $11k. There is no where to indicate this in the loan but I did not worry, I assumed I could call and speak with someone to inform them of my unique circumstance.. I was instantly declined. I called to explain my situation so a proper application could be reviewed, but was told there is no way to do that. I was told my debt to income was showing excessive and additional money could not be extended to me. I tried numerous times to explain that I am REPLACING a $335/month payment with hopefully a $100 a month payment considering the cash I wanted to put down. There is apparently no way for this ""lender"" to indicate stipulations in their loans or required payoffs, which I find crazy! How else are they supposed to properly assess someone's financial situation if their underwriting is unable to payoff someone? I don't even see how they can advertise the loans for debt consolidation.. something seems weird about that. I also did not argue the fact that my debt to income is currently 18% WITH the LendingClub loan I want to payoff. I do not have a mortgage OR rent, and only have a car payment, I was even generous in that calculation and threw in 2 minimum credit card payments, just in case. The whole purpose of this application is for a pre-approval on a morgage, so my DTI is as low as possible to allow for a higher purchase price. I was basically told that this is just the way it is... which is unacceptable.

1,"Apr 03, 2016",I applied for a small personal loan to pay off a couple of higher interest credit cards - the only debts I have - with the hopes of being able to pay more towards the principle because of the lower interest rate - whereby I would get out from under these debts quicker.
