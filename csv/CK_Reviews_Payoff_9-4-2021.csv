1,"Aug 12, 2021","I have been back and forth with them for 2 months now. I trusted your company and invested my valuable time. I clearly indicated that the 1040 I will be providing for 2020 will be showing low income due to COVID, BUT current bank statements show my business recovered and that I make way more than even what you are asking. And JUST because they ask me to do my taxes and gave me the green light on my bank statements (income) I did my taxes! On the phone they said earlier ALL looks good only thing needed left is 1040. And I just got an email after this LONG journey that they do not accept me because my 1040 shows low income?? AND WHEN I CALLED THEM THEIR EMPLOYEE JUST HUNG UP ON ME AT THE END OF THE CALL. This is not professional and all their employees do have an attitude problem. Even DMV has a better treatment. If they are not happy working for you they should just QUIT. From beginning to end the entire process was torturous. I will do my best to be sure no one around me works with them.",Horrible Experience,2,0

5,"Aug 03, 2021",Very quick and easy process. I applied on Monday evening and uploaded my documents on Tuesday. I had the money in my account by that Friday and the credit cards were paid off on Tuesday. The loan was through a credit union which gives me another good banking relationship.,"Yes, I would highly recommend!",1,0
1,"Jul 15, 2021",The application process wasn't too bad but they consistently report inaccurate payments to the credit bureaus.

1,"Jul 08, 2021","The application process seemed easy but when verifying my income, I am self-employed, instead of them asking me any questions or asking for additional documentation they started calling/contacting every company I contract with to verify my income without giving me any warning.

4,"Jul 02, 2021",I am a fan of using my banks regular auto-wire-pay rather than the auto mail in. That is not possible here but I did set up auto mail in.

2,"Jun 29, 2021","There's nothing simple about working with this company. The initial application, no big deal, but then they start emailing asking for this bill, or that bill. Send them whatever, it'll be wrong. Took days for the guy to finally say, sure, a driver's license is fine. Since then I received the deposit and paid off my cards. Now, I'm trying to pay PayOff, but they make it nearly impossible to pay them. Supposedly they now have me set up for automatic payments, but I'll believe it when I see it. It's just a completely incompetent business. I need a new loan to pay of this one now, just to save me future headaches.","Decent interest rate, terrible everything else.",10,1

The money was in my account in two days and I’m saving about $1k per month in payments due to this. Lastly, I will be debt free in three years versus the 20+ years that credit cards had me in.

4,"May 04, 2021","I have been debating whether I wanted to consolidate my debt for some time. I had a conversation with a friend and she recommended payoff. I looked into it and it gave me a great interest rate! Going from all my credit cards to one loan payment was a stress relief, not to mention how quickly the balances were paid off. Only downfall is the response from the chat customer service. Once you’re connected, they don’t respond quickly at all. Maybe the first communication, but after that it’s pointless.","Fast, easy, reliable",5,0

1,"Apr 13, 2021","I have a work visa (with which I bought my half million dollar+ house) and a very high income. I was looking at a fairly low amount and low risk. The team kept calling and emailing me, and I spoke to them to let them know I had this work visa. They said ""no problem, you are pre-approved we just need the documents uploaded"". I uploaded the documents and then they told me they don't have a legal understanding in their process for my work visa! You just told me you did! I spent time uploading all my personal information - which they won't delete they said - and wasting so so much of my time. Their legal team has no idea about non-US citizens and no way to judge risk. They have no knowledge of the law, which to me means it cascades down onto all their legal understandings and terms. I would be wary here. I withdrew my application since I was so exhausted with dealing with them and trying to re-explain a legal term no one could figure out there... I would NOT recommend them at all.",Lack of Knowledge,9,1
3,"Apr 12, 2021","Very easy to get the loan. Issues since Day 1. Extra payments made but they said they did not receive. Always a computer issue. Last month they double dipped on my automatic payment. I called them and I let the double payment stand as they assured my it would never happen again. Well, it happened this month again. Have spoken to numerous people who assure me it won't happen again. In the process of having the double payment reversed. It's amazing how quickly they can take the money but how slowly they give it back. That God I have some savings I could transfer to cover what could have been large fees for overdrafts. I'm sure not everyone can do that.",I have had issues since Day 1,5,1

1,"Apr 02, 2021","I've held a great stable job for the past few years after finishing professional school, finally felt financially stable and I'm really wanting to correct my credit card debts mistakes. I heard of payoff and they seemed to be a great option to help with my situation the way they advertised. After them sending me ""preapproved"" letters for months, I applied with credit over 640 (their requirement) with excellent/on-time/never-late payment history and chose the option to pay the most every month because I knew I could pay that or even more back each month. Disappointingly, they didn't approve my application basically because they needed to see at least 3-4x the amount of money in my bank account. School did cost a lot and there are other necessities stuff that I have to pay as well so I mean if I had 3-4x the amount they asked for at this moment, there wouldn't be a point to applying to Payoff in the first place. So I thought this was a little ridiculous and false advertising of them to say they want to help you. You'll only get their help if you already have more than enough to pay your credit card debts off all at once in your bank account, which kinds of negate the point of having the company in the first place in my opinion. All the customer service advocates were very nice on the phone, that's basically the only good thing about this company.",They don't help you,11,2

5,"Feb 20, 2021","With just under 5k left to pay off in credit card debt, as I was finally at a ""good score"", I was hesistant to take out a loan to consolidate because I didn't want to add another account and inquiry. But when I was preapproved with 11% APR (vs my average of like 26% on my cards) I realized I could pay the loan off in less than a year and save a ton of money in interest, so I went for it. Final approval took a couple business days. They needed to verify income; the woman who called me to let me know was incredibly professional and made it very easy. I was approved that same day. The only mistake I made was having a bulk of the funds delivered directly to my credit accounts; the remaining cash was in my account days before any credit showed up on my accounts. If I had just had it all sent to my checking I could have paid themyself sooner. But overall I am very happy with this loan. I've only had if for about a week and can already tell if will be quite easy to manage. Making extra payments is very easy, which is important to me. My monthly payment is less than $300 but I had been previously paying $600 a month to my credit cards. So by applying the extra payments on the loan I'll be debt free in less than a year, despite the loan term being 24 months.

1,"Jan 02, 2021","It's very difficult to payoff the Payoff loan online. I only wanted to take on short term debt to finish off student loans but got super frustrated when i realized you can't make a payment online to fully payoff the loan. You have to deal with a representative. If you look on the BBB website, these representatives often incorrectly payoff the loan and you are charged for the interest during that time. Incredibly frustrating as this could add 1-2 weeks to your loan time. This has never happened to me before with any other service. This seems like an intentional way to inflate the loan length of time, thus the amount of interest you are charged. I would avoid.",Frustrating! Can't Payoff Loan Online,44,4

2,"Nov 19, 2020","The application process was very easy, they approved and were supposed to send money in 2-5 business days, yet something went wrong and two weeks later they had to send it up the line and finally paid me, which resulted in me ending up with another interest payment on my CC. They have a horrible website system. This loan is great if you are a 100% scheduled payment at exactly the amount you agreed upon kind of person. I like to manually pay each month, sometimes more $ or sometimes make two entire payments. Unfortunately you cannot change the payment amount, and if you pay twice in a month the second payment goes towards the principle, which leaves you with a missed interest payment due the next month, but if you want to pay that interest you end up having to make a whole other payment because you can't change the amount!! They have 24/7 customer service almost which is great but these people often confuse themselves and aren't very helpful. Very aggravating and unprofessional loan system.",B-rated version of a real bank loan,103,11
2,"Nov 17, 2020","Interest rate was high (close to 20%) with 700+ score. The preapproval was no where near what my final rate was. However, the entire process was seamless. Now, the wait times when calling in is extremely long, luckily they now have a call back option where they will reach out to you. Payments: After you make your monthly payment, you cannot make an additional payment until your next statement is generated. So if you would like to pay additional principal, or just an additional payment, you cannot do so. Next, your payments take a few days to process. Then it takes 2-3 days for this to post to your account. Now this is minor I know, but when you are paying interest that is compounded daily this adds up to a lot of money; Payoff is making a lot of money by doing this. This is my 2nd personal loan, first with Payoff. However, if approved by the first company I used, I would not use Payoff again. Members are friendly yes, but there website is clunky and not user friendly. I couldn't make online payments due to an issue with their system and it was never resolved nor was it ever followed up on by a manager. I was promised it would be fixed but it never was. It was a time consuming process to have a payment made. If you're in a bind, go for it.",Expensive but helpful,38,6

4,"Oct 12, 2020","Requested to consolidate my credit cards. I had more than 10 cards all above 20% interest rate but one at 11.

This offer did show three rates lower. When I thinking about it I clicked and started but then took a day to confirm final before pushing through with which rate. When I came back the next day I decided to change to the middle offer but I had to instant messanger to get it changed as it was already locked at the prior day. She did forewarn that there is a possibility of fee to change rate which made no sense when I did not agree to anything yet. But it still was cheaper so continued. And it did not cost anything to switch at that time. The only thing is originally when started it had me put in CCs to payoff but when finally pushed through documents only 3 were direct and the rest funds were just dropped in for me to pay direct which was not a big deal but just fyi that even though it may say initially can send payoff on some accounts, check your final agreement and make sure to match your debt after. It did end up matching the final agreement. It only took 2 days to post the funds into my account, and 3-4 days for the cc's to be paid off for the ones direct.

5,"Sep 25, 2019","I will admit that seeing a Payoff advertisement on my Instagram feed made me skeptical. I pondered on this for months. I have been wanting to consolidate my credit card debt into one payment and eliminate as much interest fees as I could. After settling into a better paying job, I decided the time is now. I received an email saying to check my rates and see what they can offer. I did and was pleasantly surprised. It'd cut three years of payments, nearly $550 in interest fees, and a whole lot of stress. The process was a little long but that was only because I wasn't sending the correct documents however, the customer service team at Payoff was quick to let me know what I was missing so we could proceed with the loan. After about a week, I was approved for the loan! I was having issues signing my official acceptance documents but they kept me updated along the way. During the time I was waiting for my documents, I received another email stating if my loan was fulfilled before the end of the month that I'd receive an Amazon gift card and to check my rates now. Seeing as I had already been approved, I was bummed at this missed opportunity. However, I reached out to their customer service line and they stated that I indeed qualified for the gift card and I'll receive it in about a week. So awesome! The funds hit my account after about 4 business days and now I'm on my way to relieving myself of credit card debt. My suggestion is to just make sure you have the qualifications before applying and sending all your information. The process was so simple, the customer service was friendly and attentive, and they delivered what was promised in the time frame stated. I have nothing but good things to say about my experience with Payoff. :)",,138,7

Of course, I read the disclaimer that the offer is based on current credit profile and can be subject to change - but that's not what happened. My credit profile hasn't changed much in 20 years, even though, of course, the actual score fluctuates based on the credit bureau's infamously inaccurate algorithms.

I live far out from town and the post office doesn't deliver to the house so everything is addressed a P.O. Box. They said anything I could send to show my address was needed. I sent them my car registration which has the P,O, Box and my house address. They accepted that without any hesitation. This shows me that they really want to help and will work with you on a case by case basis. I had applied at another site before this, that wanted a lot of paperwork including tax returns. By the time I got everything to them they said they would review and get back to me. In the time it took them to review my paperwork, my loan quote expired.

1,"Sep 27, 2016","This is literally the worst experience I've ever had with Credit Karma and Payoff loans. Credit Karma tells me that my credit score is over 700 and I have a very good chance of being approved for this loan. I apply for said loan, Payoff says my credit score is 653, 7 points below their minimum requirement. Customer rep says they are ""very transparent"" with how they calculate credit scores, but apparently Credit Karma is not on the same page. What the hell is the point of ""partnering"" with a company, claiming transparency in credit scores, and then using a completely different credit score than the one credit karma is using? Are you purposely trying to mislead people? This is my second time being rejected by Payoff for this ridiculous reason. I have had credit cards for over five years, have never missed a payment, and was simply looking for a smart, fast way to pay down debt with lower interest. The customer service rep at Payoff suggested I try to payoff my credit cards with larger monthly payments... DUH... so I'll just continue to throw money at my higher interest credit cards until Credit Karma and Payoff actually achieve transparency and continuity in their credit reporting and recommendations. Doubtful! Credit Karma - Try actually displaying the credit score that Payoff will be using when suggesting that I'd be approved for this loan. Thank goodness the check that this company does for your credit score doesn't adversely affect your score, or just-not-good-enough people like myself would be even more screwed! Payoff - Average customer service, but 7 points? Really? For a loan of $8k, you're going to deny someone with perfect payment history and steady employment? I don't think I want a loan from your company after all. I mean, why offer me a loan of $8k now, when in five years, my debt could spiral to $15k and if or when I reapply (with a more Payoff-acceptable credit history) you can possibly profit further? I'll be discontinuing my Credit Karma account because it's completely and totally useless, inaccurate, and misleading.",Frustrating and Misleading,10,0

5,"Jul 11, 2016","I applied (and was approved) for a $9,000 loan. For my first time ever taking out a personal loan, this was so easy when I'd expected to have to jump through hoops to be approved. I was approved within a few days for the requested amount, with an interest rate of 11.96% and APR of 14% (less than half the rate my credit cards were charging me!). I was making my monthly payments (of the 24-month term I chose), and if I wanted to make a larger payment in addition to my monthly payment, I needed to mail in a check. Recently, Payoff perfected their system by allowing users to make additional payments online. Now, only 8 months after taking out the loan, I've finally paid off the complete loan, my credit cards are debt-free, and my credit is looking great! And as a plus, their customer service is impeccable. The reps are knowledgeable and friendly, and they send monthly reminders a few days before they withdraw the monthly payment. Would definitely recommend!!",Extremely easy,33,1

5,"Jun 29, 2016",I applied on a Sunday night and was approved by Tuesday afternoon. They sent a verification email to my work email and asked for a copy of a bank statement that was it. You can select your terms as far as how many months which changes payment amount. The only thing I did not like was they base your amount that you can borrow based off of your credit report. One credit card balance was a lot higher than credit report showed so I would have had to wait another 30 days to see if company updated credit report. But other than that no issues and a smooth process,Very simple process,2,0
5,"Jun 18, 2016","The process is quick and simple. It takes less than 5 minutes to apply and there is no confusing language or questions requiring a lot of obscure information. The approval process was fast--even for someone like me who put a security alert on my credit, which required extra validation steps and an additional phone call. The best feature is the option for them to pay off debts they find on your credit report automatically and disburse any leftover funds to your account. There are no tricks or gimmicks. There is one origination fee that is clearly displayed and explained. In fact that fee screen is not just a jumble of tiny print. It is a separate screen where you actively have to select your loan AND fee amount. On that screen it shows you how much the fee will be based on your loan amount and loan term AND IT ALSO TELLS YOU how much of that you will get disbursed to you IN ADDITION TO the APR. The screen is clutter free and easily understandable. There is an FAQ section that is very helpful too. It does not take careful reading or a genius IQ to understand the terms and the cost of the loan. Choosing the costs (including their standard fees, and your loan amount and loan term) is a required step and the numbers are repeated throughout the remainder of the application so you know what you are agreeing to. The fees are not based solely on credit score or anything like that. Instead, the screen tells you that the fees are generated based on the amount of the loan, which YOU choose. That enables them to keep the APR rates lower than their competitors and saves the consumer money over the life of the loan. The APR works the same as APR calculations on other consumer loan products. It is also slightly adjustable for the consumer because it is based in part on the loan term, which the consumer chooses. Definitely the look into this loan. The service was simple, easy, personal and user friendly. I highly recommend it.",Easy and Quick,23,0

Now i will be credit card debt free and also be saving a lot of money from doing this. I am very happy with this company!

2,"Feb 29, 2016","I have a 725 credit score. Wanted to borrow money to consolidate my credit cards. Have never been late for a payment. Payoff immediately said I was pre qualified and gave me a great rate. I had to send them my last month bank statement. (WTF). I did it. I had some big withdrawals because of Christmas, etc. Mind you, I have never filed bankruptcy, never been late on a payment. A representative called me. Asked a few questions.Then I waited for several days, wandering what was going on. Well, finally, on Friday, they send me an email. Thanks for applying but we cannot give you a loan because of threat of not being able to pay it back. What? Sent an email to lending club. They also gave me a great rate. Long story short, closed my loan in 3 days with Lending Club. Now Payoff tells me in an email they are going to use my information to send to other companies for solicitation for car loans, etc. Says I have to opt out. Very humiliating to turn me down then send an email to state something like that. Will never borrow money from them.

The customer service was exemplary and any questions or concerns I had were addressed in a timely manner. I would give them 5 stars if it were not for 2 major drawbacks. First, any extra payments you would like to make over and above your monthly payment, must be made by check. There is no way to pay electronically. While this isn't a huge deal (especially if you don't plan to make extra payments) the inability to make a payment online in 2016 seems a bit ridiculous. Secondly. several times when I've logged into my account recently I've received a message stating ""Your loan details and payment activity are temporarily unavailable"". I don't know if this is an issue with the site itself or my account in particular, but it's very frustrating. So in conclusion, I was very pleased with the application process and with all the interactions I've had with customer service. I believe that Payoff.com really does care about their customers and they want to see them succeed in paying off their credit cards.

3,"Jul 20, 2015","I really liked Payoff and was hoping to complete my loan with them.

I made sure to ask this question when I called in to customer service and I was told that they did not at this time but were looking to do so in the future. Since they couldn't let me know when they would start doing this, I moved onto Lending Club who offered the same rate as well as confirming that they do report to all three credit bureaus. If you are looking to payoff some credit card debt and are not concerned about improving your credit score, then I would recommend Payoff.
